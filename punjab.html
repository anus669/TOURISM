    <p>Minar E Pakistan literally "Tower of Pakistan") is a tower located in Lahore, Pakistan.[2] The tower was built between 1960 and 1968 on the site where the All-India Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution (which was later called the Pakistan Resolution) on 23 March 1940 - the first official call for a separate and independent homeland for the Muslims of British India, as espoused by the two-nation theory. The resolution eventually helped lead to the emergence of an independent Pakistani state in 1947.[3][4]

        The tower is located in the middle of an urban park, called the Greater Iqbal Park.[5]</p>
